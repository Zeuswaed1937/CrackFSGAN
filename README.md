Crack image generation, as a crucial yet challenging visual task, still struggles with the quality-diversity trade-off under data scarcity. We thus propose CrackFSGAN, a generative method with few-shot adaptation capable of producing high-fidelity and diverse images of dam cracks from a limited dataset of about 100 real images. This framework improves upon deep convolutional generative adversarial network by simultaneously introducing a Cross-Scale Channel Interaction module and a Self-Supervised Discriminator. The Cross-Scale Channel Interaction module enables robust gradient flow across network weights for efficient training, while Self-Supervised Discriminator, redesigned as a feature-encoder with an additional decoder, can learn more discriminative feature-map covering more regions from input images. Notably, the method supports high-resolution crack generation beyond conventional low-resolution applications. 

Below are sample images generated by CrackFSGAN, corresponding to various training sample sizes and image resolutions.
