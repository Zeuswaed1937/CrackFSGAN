Crack detection critically impacts dam safety and operational stability. While deep learning-based rapid detection techniques have been widely applied, they demand substantial high-quality dam crack images that are inherently challenging to acquire. This paper proposes CrackFSGAN, a generative method with few-shot adaptation capable of producing high-fidelity and diverse images of dam cracks from a limited dataset of about 100 real images. This framework improves upon deep convolutional generative adversarial network by simultaneously introducing a Cross-Scale Channel Interaction module and a Self-Supervised Discriminator. Extensive comparative experiments against established image generation methods confirm the superiority of our approach. We further demonstrate the practical value of the synthetic images by showing their effectiveness in augmenting the performance of deep learning models for image classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. Notably, the method supports high-resolution (1024 Ã— 1024 pixel2) crack generation beyond conventional low-resolution applications. Results demonstrate that CrackFSGAN significantly outperforms existing methods in generation quality, effectively addressing data scarcity in dam crack analysis while improving deep learning model performance.
